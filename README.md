A quick hack of jmdajm7's living worlds. [source](https://github.com/jmdajm7/living-worlds). 

When loaded with a web browser, it will display a random scene for two hours before randomly switching to another.
The intent was to be able to use these scenes as desktop wallpapers by loading them as a webpage using tools such as [this](https://store.kde.org/p/2137308).
